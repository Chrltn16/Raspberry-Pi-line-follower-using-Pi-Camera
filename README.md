# Raspberry-Pi-line-follower-using-Pi-Camera
# Autonomous Line Following Robot with Raspberry Pi

This project is aimed at building an autonomous line-following robot using a Raspberry Pi and a PiCamera module. The robot uses computer vision techniques to detect and follow black lines on a surface.

## Features

- Autonomous line following using computer vision
- PID control for smooth and accurate line tracking
- Real-time display of camera feed with overlaid line detection
- Adjustable parameters for PID control and line detection

## Hardware Requirements

- Raspberry Pi (tested on Raspberry Pi 3 Model B)
- PiCamera module
- Motor driver (L293D)
- DC motors and wheels
- Power source (battery pack)
- Black line track or white surface for testing

## Software Requirements

- Python 3.x
- OpenCV library
- PiCamera library
- PiMotor library

## Installation

1. Clone this repository to your Raspberry Pi:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/chrltn16/Raspberry-Pi-line-follower-using-Pi-Camera.git
